# GSOC-2025
he Beehive project aims to create a digital platform that stores, organizes, and retrieves images related to behavioral health. These images, often categorized as Outsider Art, are produced by marginalized individuals and serve as a tool for research, advocacy, and healthcare insights. The project’s goal is to develop a prototype that allows users to upload images, store them with metadata, and retrieve them efficiently for analysis.

Technical Solution Provided
To achieve the project’s objectives, I proposed a Python-based prototype that leverages Google Colab for implementation and eliminates the need for MongoDB, working directly with stored image files instead.

1. Image Upload and Storage System
Users can upload images in formats like PNG, JPG, JPEG directly.

The images are stored in a structured directory with associated metadata (title, creator, date, description, etc.).

2. Metadata Handling and Database Structure
Instead of MongoDB, a CSV file or SQLite database is used to store image metadata.

Metadata includes image name, category, tags, and descriptions for easy retrieval.

3. Image Retrieval and Search
Users can search for images based on metadata attributes like name, category, or tags.

The system retrieves images and displays them along with their metadata.

4. User Interaction and Frontend Development (Basic UI in Colab)
Google Colab widgets allow a simple UI for image uploads and retrieval.

Users can select images from a dropdown list for easy access.

5. Open Source Compatibility and Documentation
The code is modular and well-documented to ensure future enhancements.

It is optimized for performance, ensuring smooth handling of large image datasets.

Why This Solution?
Lightweight & Easy to Deploy → No complex DB setup required.

Google Colab Friendly → Runs entirely online with no local dependencies.

Open-Source Friendly → Simple structure makes it easy for contributors to enhance.

Scalable → Can be later integrated with a proper database (MongoDB, MySQL) if needed.
